{- Note [Surface syntax through OverloadedRecordDot]
We (ab)use the @OverloadedRecordDot@ extension to provide a nice type-safe syntax for our eDSL.

If we were (and we originally were) to create a program manually, we'd get something along the lines
of

    sumTo10Stmts :: Body ()
    sumTo10Stmts = do
        declareVarF "n" 10
        declareVarF "acc" 0
        while (varF "n" `gt` 0) $ do
            assignVarF "acc" (varF "acc" + varF "n")
            assignVarF "n" (varF "n" - 1)
        ret $ varF "acc"

This is a pretty regular way of manually creating an AST, but regular ways of creating ASTs aren't
exactly known for their ergonomics or type safety. In our case

- Two quotes for each variable and manual type disambiguation (the "F" suffixes) create a lot of
  visual noise.
- The Haskell type checker
  * won't save you from using an undeclared variable.
  * won't save you from declaring the same variable twice (potentially with different types).
  * won't save you from declaring one type for a variable and subsequently assigning a value of a
    different type to the variable.
  * generally won't be able to infer the type of a value that you're assigning to or already storing
    in a variable. Which in our case requires you to manually pick different variable assignment /
    referencing functions depending on the type of the variable -- bloating the API and creating
    more room for mistake.

This module implements syntax sugar making it more pleasant and type-safe to create ASTs by hand.
Here's how the program above looks with the sugar (obviously, it elaborates to the same thing):

    sumTo10Stmts :: Body ()
    sumTo10Stmts = do
        Felt <- declare.n 10
        Felt <- declare.acc 0
        while (get.n `gt` 0) $ do
            set.acc $ get.acc + get.n
            set.n $ get.n - 1
        ret get.acc

Let's dive into the machinery feature by feature.

The most basic features are declaring variables, as well as setting and getting their values. E.g.

    declareSetGetFelt :: Body ()
    declareSetGetFelt = do
        Felt <- declare.x 42
        set.x 3
        ret get.x

Here's how this program elaborates:

    >>> import Data.Foldable
    >>> import Nightfall.Lang.Types (runBody)
    >>> traverse_ print $ runBody declareSetGetFelt
    DeclVariable "x" (Lit (42 `modulo` 18446744069414584321))
    AssignVar "x" (Lit (3 `modulo` 18446744069414584321))
    Return (VarF "x")

As you can see the @x@ name that we introduced via @declare@ became the @"x"@ name in the code.

Variable names are not hardcoded in any way, you can declare the same @x@ variable as being a
boolean one:

    declareSetGetBool :: Body ()
    declareSetGetBool = do
        Bool <- declare.x $ bool True
        set.x $ bool False
        ret get.x

or instead of a single-letter name use something more appropriate for serious production:

    declareSetGetProductionBool :: Body ()
    declareSetGetProductionBool = do
        Bool <- declare.suchEnterpriseNameWowMuchDescriptive $ bool True
        set.suchEnterpriseNameWowMuchDescriptive $ bool False
        ret get.suchEnterpriseNameWowMuchDescriptive

If you attempt to declare the same variable twice, you'll get a Haskell type error:

    declareTwiceFelt :: Body ()
    declareTwiceFelt = do
        Felt <- declare.x 42
        -- error: [GHC-64725]
        --     • 'x' is declared twice
        Felt <- declare.x 3
        pure ()

If you attempt to initialize a 'Felt' variable with a boolean value, you'll get another Haskell type
error:

    declareFeltBool :: Body ()
    declareFeltBool = do
        -- error: [GHC-18872]
        --     • Couldn't match type ‘DeclBool’ with ‘DeclFelt’
        Felt <- declare.x $ bool True
        pure ()

If you attempt to use an undeclared variable, you'll get a Haskell type error too, although not a
very readable one currently:

    getUndeclared :: Body ()
    getUndeclared =
        -- error: [GHC-39999]
        --     • No instance for ‘KnownType (TypeOf "x")’
        ret get.x

Note that in the example above

    declareSetGetFelt :: Body ()
    declareSetGetFelt = do
        Felt <- declare.x 42
        set.x 3
        ret get.x

the type of @42@ and @3@ (whose unmonomorphised type is @Num a => a@) in inferred to be 'Felt',
because of matching on the 'Felt' constructor, the user doesn't need to disambiguate types manually,
a single match is enough.

TODO: describe 'mut'.

{- Note [Alternative surface syntax implementations]
(P)HOAS can be convenient, but it has a number of drawbacks:

- It falls short when it comes to static handling of names, e.g. we wouldn't be able to implement
  throwing a type error when the same variable is declared twice, because variable names are runtime
  info with (P)HOAS unlike with our approach where names exist at the Haskell's type level.
- When using (P)HOAS one has to actually bind a Haskell variable whenever they want to use a
  variable of the target language, which can be a hassle in cases when it's enough to merely know
  that the target language variable exists. For example, if you have a global target language
  variable that all procedures can read from / write to, then with HOAS you'd have to carry it
  around in all functions as an argument, while with our approach we can simply reassure the type
  checker that the variable exists using a 'declare'-like construct or introduce 'gget' and 'gset'
  for global variable reading and global variable writing etc. Point is, our approach is quite more
  flexible than (P)HOAS.
- Having to use Haskell names with (P)HOAS necessarily entails having to avoid clashing with names
  of common Haskell functions. It would be annoying to force the user to avoid shadowing names
  like @sum@, @null@, @and@, @elem@, @even@, @id@, @map@, @last@, @length@ or hide them from the
  implicitly imported Prelude. We even use the @length@ in our own tests!

Another thing we could do differently is use the @OverloadedLabels@ extension instead of
@OverloadedRecordDot@, but the simplest approach would require us to write @f (get #x)@ instead of
@f get.x@, which doesn't appear to be an improvement at all, so if we were to use overloaded labels,
we'd probably have to commit to @#x@ meaning different things in different contexts (for example
@set #x@ would elaborate one way and @#x + #y@ would elaborate a completely different way), which
sounds like it's not gonna play very nice with type inference unless we use @INCOHERENT@ pragmas,
which are brittle. Plus those hashes seem like a lot of visual noise, perhaps simply due to the
sheer amount of ink in them.
